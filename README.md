# Student-Performance-Prediction-using-Ensemble-Learning-Random-Forest-
This project aims to predict student academic outcomes (Pass/Fail) by analyzing a combination of demographic, behavioral, and academic features. By leveraging multiple machine learning algorithms, the project identifies key factors that contribute to student success and provides a robust prediction framework.
